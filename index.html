    <h1>Discovering Spain: Football, Culture & More</h1>
    <p>Traveling to Spain is like opening a living encyclopedia of culture. From its grand cathedrals to golden beaches, from Goya’s art to Iniesta’s magic, this country blends history, flavors, and emotions. What always drew me in was its passion for football—an unconditional love felt in every square, bar, and stadium. That’s why I decided to follow the path of the ball across Spain... but also let the journey surprise me with so much more.</p>

    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I have been a football fan since I was a kid, and for years I dreamed of attending a Clásico between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. One day, without thinking twice, I booked a flight, packed a backpack, and had one idea: to live football passion from the inside. But I also wanted to explore the country beyond stadiums—getting lost in ancient streets, trying new dishes, visiting museums, and relaxing on beaches.</p>
    <p>Every city showed me a different rhythm. In some, I was moved by goals; in others, by landscapes. I walked, got lost, talked to locals, and laughed. I tried to travel consciously: walking when possible, supporting local businesses, avoiding waste. Small gestures that made me feel part of the place.</p>
